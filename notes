when deleting posts - tags are deleted through taggings. May need to try to delete through tags directly. Although works for now.

we have temporarily disabled: index page redirecting to landing page when not signed in. This is so that we can actually test the site ourselves.
  - we x'd line 10 of posts feature spec

at the moment we are displaying the email of the creator of a post, not the username. Need this from Git

we had to have (maybe) non-restful links for liking and disliking posts.
